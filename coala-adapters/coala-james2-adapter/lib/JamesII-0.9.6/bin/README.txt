INSTALLATION NOTES

Simply start the james-ii-core-***.jar file (double-lick on it, or execute "java -jar james-ii-core-***.jar" in the command line).

To get a first impression, go to menu "Workflow" > "Start Simple M&S" and load one of the sample models from the 'samples' directory.

Visit our web site (http://www.jamesii.org) for tutorials, help, and news.

PLEASE NOTE: some models require a JDK to simulate them. Please make sure that you start JAMES II with a JDK and not with a normal JRE! Otherwise these models cannot be used (but JAMES II will still run).
